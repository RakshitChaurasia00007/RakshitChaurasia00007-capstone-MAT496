 # Car Knowledge Assistant with 3-Expert Verification System using LangGraph



 ## Overview of The whole CAPSTONE PROJECT

### Well! Our Car Knowledge Assistant uses am AI-powered Web Search and a unique 3-expert verification system to answer automotive questions with the verified and reliable information.​

When you just ask any question about the car maintenance, repairs, features, or even just troubleshooting:

Expert 1 => (Primary Mechanic) : Searches across the web and provides an initial detailed answer​.

Expert 2 => (Verification Specialist) : Cross-checks all the information for accuracy and then identifies any errors​.

Expert 3 => (Conflict Resolver) : Reviews both the experts, resolves conflicts, and then delivers the final authoritative answer​.

My main focus was to make the overall system ,ust get built using the LangGraph for the multi-agent workflow orchestration, Tavily web search for real-time automotive information retrieval, and structured output with Pydantic models for the consistent, safety-focused responses.​

Results for the programme are displayed in a clean dashboard showing the confidence levels, verification status, issues found, and the source citations ensuring you get the trustworthy car maintenance guidance. This programme is highly recommended to every CAR Enthusiast.
